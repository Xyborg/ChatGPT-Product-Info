## How to Use

### Method 1: Browser Console (Recommended)

1. **Open ChatGPT** in your browser and make sure you're logged in
2. **Open Developer Tools**:
   - **Chrome/Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - **Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac) - you may need to enable Developer Tools first
3. **Go to Console tab** in the Developer Tools
4. **Copy the entire content of the script** from `chatgpt-product-info.js`
5. **Paste and press Enter** - the modal will appear immediately
6. **Start searching** for products!

### Method 2: Bookmarklet

Due to CORS restrictions, you'll need to create a proper bookmarklet using a bookmarklet generator:

1. **Copy the entire script** from `chatgpt-product-info.js`
2. **Go to a bookmarklet generator**:
   - [Bookmarkleter](https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter) (Recommended)
   - [Bookmarklet Maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker)
3. **Paste the script** into the generator
4. **Generate the bookmarklet** - it will create a `javascript:` URL
5. **Create a new bookmark** in your browser with:
   - **Name**: "ChatGPT Product Search" 
   - **URL**: The generated `javascript:` code
6. **Visit ChatGPT** and click the bookmark to launch the search tool

**Note**: The bookmarklet will be quite long due to the script size, but it will work properly without CORS issues.

## Technical Details

### How It Works

The script leverages ChatGPT's internal `/backend-api/search/product_info` endpoint, which is the same API that powers ChatGPT's built-in product search functionality. It:

1. **Authenticates** using your existing ChatGPT session
2. **Sends search queries** to ChatGPT's product API
3. **Parses streaming responses** in real-time
4. **Extracts structured data** including products, reviews, and citations
5. **Renders results** in a beautiful, organized interface

### API Endpoint
```
POST https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/search/product_info
```

### Authentication
The script automatically fetches your session token from `/api/auth/session` - no manual token input required!

### Data Structure
The API returns structured data including:
- Product entities with pricing and merchant information
- Review summaries with sentiment analysis
- Citation links to source websites
- Rationale and summary text
