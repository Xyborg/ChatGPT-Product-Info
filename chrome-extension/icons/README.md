# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any image editor. The icon should represent product search functionality - suggestions:

- Shopping cart with magnifying glass
- Search icon with shopping bag
- Product/package with search symbol

## Placeholder Icons

For development, you can use simple placeholder images or even create basic colored squares with text. The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use defaults).

## Icon Guidelines

- Use simple, clear designs that work at small sizes
- Maintain consistent style across all sizes
- Use contrasting colors for visibility
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines
